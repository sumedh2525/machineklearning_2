    "Q1: Define overfitting and underfitting in machine learning. What are the consequences of each, and how\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    " In machine learning, overfitting and underfitting are two common problems that can occur when training a model. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well and is not able to generalize to new data. Underfitting occurs when the model does not learn the training data well enough and is not able to make accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting can be caused by a number of factors, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a complex model that is too flexible.\n",
    "Training the model for too long.\n",
    "Not having enough training data.\n",
    "The consequences of overfitting can be severe. The model may perform very well on the training data, but it will not be able to make accurate predictions on new data. This can lead to significant losses, especially in applications where accurate predictions are critical.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "There are a number of techniques that can be used to reduce overfitting. These techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization: Regularization is a technique that penalizes the model for being too complex. This helps to prevent the model from fitting the noise in the training data. There are two common types of regularization: L1 regularization and L2 regularization. L1 regularization adds a penalty to the sum of the absolute values of the model's weights. L2 regularization adds a penalty to the sum of the squared values of the model's weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Early stopping: Early stopping is a technique that stops training the model before it has fully converged. This helps to prevent the model from fitting the noise in the training data. Early stopping is typically done by monitoring the model's performance on a held-out dataset. When the model's performance on the held-out dataset starts to decrease, the training is stopped.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data augmentation: Data augmentation is a technique that artificially increases the size of the training dataset. This can help to prevent the model from overfitting by making the training dataset more diverse. Data augmentation can be done by applying transformations to the training data, such as flipping, rotating, and cropping images.\n",
    "\n",

    "Feature selection: Feature selection is a technique that selects the most important features from the training dataset. This can help to prevent the model from overfitting by reducing the size of the model's hypothesis space."
